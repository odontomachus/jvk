I am building a minimal static site generator to allow me to: build pages in html/jinja. I am doing this rather than using a known static site generator for a few reasons.

I am a programmer, and I work in emacs. I don't want a web interface without my keyboard shortcuts and all that. I also don't particulary to write Markdown. And finally, I like having control over what I output. Therefore, I am outputting html, using vanilla js rather than a framework, and writing my own minimalist css. I don't need infinite functionality, and often I am more interested in building the extra magic I need than in using it.

The main features I want: lightweight, no bloat, tons of downloads, etc. Multilingual, merci. Customizable. Light configuration.

So here it is.
